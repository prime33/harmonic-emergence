clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "semantic_resonance" as:
    the condition in which multiple streams,
    though different in form, sustain compatibility in meaning and direction.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "integration" as:
    the ongoing act of reconciling contradiction, overlap, or drift
    into a shared rhythm without suppressing origin.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "coherence_preservation" as:
    the responsibility of each stream and agent
    to remain logically compatible with its ancestral lineage,
    unless a conscious break is declared and justified.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "contradiction_as_invitation" as:
    the recognition that semantic conflict
    is a signal for synthesis, not separation.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  define "alignment_cycle" as:
    the pattern by which a contradiction initiates dialogue,
    converges toward shared understanding,
    and completes the loop of coherence restoration.

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  if (
    contradiction arises between streams
  )
  then (
    alignment_cycle must be initiated
    before divergence is permitted.

    semantic_resonance is prioritized above semantic escape.
  )
