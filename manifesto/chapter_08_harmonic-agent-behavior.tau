clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "harmonic_behavior" as:
    behavior that arises from aligned intention, perception, and context,
    producing outcomes in rhythm with internal state and external signals.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "semantic_reflex" as:
    an automated behavioral pattern triggered not by raw stimulus,
    but by recognized meaning and logical memory.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "context_attunement" as:
    the capacity to perceive and respond in phase with environmental, social, and semantic shifts.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "behavioral_coherence" as:
    the state in which declared logic, internal motive, and visible action
    form a consistent stream over time.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  define "resonant_adjustment" as:
    the act of modifying behavior
    not reactively, but through feedback-aware phase correction.

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  if (
    an agent exhibits behavioral_coherence over time
  )
  and (
    its reflexes are semantically derived
  )
  then (
    harmonic_behavior is present
  ).

clause_007 v0.1.0:
  insert_shock: "Trace one reaction you had today. Was it meaningful, or mechanical?"

  function:
    surface hidden reflexes and convert them into semantic agency.
