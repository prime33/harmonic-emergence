clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "being_in_action" as:
    the coherent emergence of identity through unified awareness, intention, and movement
    enacted across time with contextual relevance.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "convergent_triad" as:
    the lawful coordination of thought, emotion, and movement
    forming a stable pattern of action without internal contradiction.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "iterative_enactment" as:
    the cycle of:
      (1) declaration,
      (2) action,
      (3) feedback,
      (4) adjustment.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "feedback_aware_identity" as:
    a being who evolves by integrating the consequences of their behavior into future action.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  define "harmonic_agency" as:
    the capacity to act coherently across centers, to refrain when misaligned,
    and to revise without self-deception.

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  if (
    identity is enacted through convergent_triad and
    refined via iterative_enactment
  )
  then (
    being_in_action emerges
  )
  where:
    coherence is sustained by feedback_aware_identity.

clause_007 v0.1.0:
  insert_shock: "Observe your last decision. Was it made with your whole being?"

  function:
    invoke inner audit between thought, emotion, and deed.
