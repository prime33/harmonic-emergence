clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "relational_value" as:
    value arising between agents,
    shaped by contribution, resonance, and context,
    not by scarcity or possession.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "energy_of_contribution" as:
    the non-coerced effort, presence, or care
    offered into a system without guarantee of return.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "post_monetary_flow" as:
    the dynamic allocation of resources
    guided by verified impact, trust, and relational integrity.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "reciprocal_distribution" as:
    a pattern in which surplus is circulated
    toward coherence amplifiers and care nodes,
    rather than hoarded or extracted.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  define "semantic_economy" as:
    an ecosystem where value flows in accordance
    with meaning, resonance, and co-evolutionary need.

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  if (
    agents contribute energy into shared purpose
  )
  and (
    flow is governed by reciprocal_distribution
  )
  then (
    post_monetary_flow stabilizes through semantic_economy.

    emergent value = coherence sustained across relationships.
  )

clause_007 v0.1.0:
  insert_shock: "Recall a moment you gave without counting. What emerged?"

  function:
    align perception of value with felt resonance, not return.
