clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "governance" as:
    the ongoing process by which multiple agents coordinate shared reality
    using declarations, protocols, and feedback to align behavior.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "logic_stream" as:
    a semantically structured, versionable stream of clauses
    capable of expressing reasoned declarations, causal links, and revisions.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "semantic_consent" as:
    agreement reached not through coercion or vote,
    but through mutual comprehension and alignment of meaning.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "syntax_evolution" as:
    the ability for governance protocols to refine themselves
    in response to contradiction, feedback, or contextual change.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  define "authority_as_clarity" as:
    a model where the most precise, transparent contributor
    holds temporary influence â€” not by position, but coherence of expression.

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  if (
    agents participate in shared logic_streams and
    align through semantic_consent
  )
  then (
    governance emerges as a reflexive process,
    sustained by syntax_evolution and feedback coherence
  ).

clause_007 v0.1.0:
  insert_shock: "Before you speak next, ask: Is what I say executable as logic?"

  function:
    bring attention to the precision and clarity of speech as governance.
