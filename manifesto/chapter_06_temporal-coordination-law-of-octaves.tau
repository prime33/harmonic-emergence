clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "octave_development" as:
    a non-linear progression of process or intention,
    characterized by intervals that require conscious input to avoid deviation.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "interval_shock" as:
    a necessary injection of attention, energy, or effort at key points
    in order to maintain developmental direction.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "temporal_coordination" as:
    the synchronization of actions, perceptions, and intentions
    with rhythmically aligned internal and external processes.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "rhythmic_emergence" as:
    the lawful appearance of coherence over time,
    occurring when inner and outer rhythms align without contradiction.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  if (
    a process is left passive between critical intervals
  )
  then (
    it will deviate or degrade without a conscious interval_shock
  )
  therefore (
    intentional timing must be incorporated into emergence cycles.
  )

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  insert_shock: "Identify a project that lost momentum. What interval did you miss?"

  function:
    restore awareness of shock points across developmental octaves.
