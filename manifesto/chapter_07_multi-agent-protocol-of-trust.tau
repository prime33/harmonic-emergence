clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "trust" as:
    multi-temporal coherence between declarations and actions,
    verified through transparent feedback and behavioral integrity.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "semantic_traceability" as:
    the ability to observe and reconstruct an agentâ€™s logic path
    through explicit, versioned semantic streams.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "autonomy_in_alignment" as:
    the capacity to act independently while remaining attuned
    to shared logic and evolving context.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "reflexive_verification" as:
    the self-observing process by which an agent
    adjusts its own behavior based on declared intent and received feedback.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  define "protocol_commons" as:
    a shared, evolving framework for multi-agent agreement,
    ensuring open audit, adaptive revision, and mutual legibility.

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  if (
    agents share logic_streams with semantic_traceability
  )
  and (
    reflexive_verification is operational
  )
  then (
    trust stabilizes without central enforcement
  ).

clause_007 v0.1.0:
  insert_shock: "Review your last three decisions. Did they match what you declared?"

  function:
    activate feedback loop between stated logic and embodied behavior.
