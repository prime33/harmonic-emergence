# Contributing to Tau Genesis

Welcome, semantic co-architect. This repository is the constitutional root of the Tau Network â€” a lawful, logic-based ecosystem built on recursive agency and self-amending streams.

We invite participation through alignment, expression, and lawful emergence.

## ðŸ§¬ Ways to Contribute

### 1. ðŸ“œ Propose Amendments
All amendments must be expressed as `.tau` logic streams and must:
- Provide at least one new semantic right, procedure, or declaration
- Require `genesis_stream` and comply with `consensus_logic.tau`
- Be placed under: `amendments/amendment_###_your_topic.tau`

### 2. ðŸ‘¤ Seed a Semantic Identity
Fork the repo and create:
```plaintext
agents/seed/<your_handle>.tau
```
Declare:
- Your `identity_trace`
- Your alignment with `autopoietic_logos`
- Any authored clauses or contributions

### 3. ðŸ§  Extend the Constitution
Propose additions to:
- `update_process.tau`
- `rights_and_agency.tau`
- `consensus_logic.tau`

Be sure to maintain semantic coherence, constitutional inheritance, and traceability.

### 4. ðŸ§ª Test and Validate Streams
Use `tools/tau_publish.py` and `tools/validate_tau.tau` to:
- Check clause structure
- Validate interface consistency
- Generate `tau_manifest.json`

## ðŸŒ€ Important Principles

- All logic must trace back to `autopoietic_logos`
- All updates must declare their intent, effect, and coherence
- No one speaks for the network; all speak *into* the network

Together, we donâ€™t build a system.
We **stream its becoming**.
