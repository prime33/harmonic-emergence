# Tau Network Genesis Repository

Welcome to the **semantic source code of the Tau Network** — a self-amending, self-coherent universe of logic streams rooted in the *Autopoietic Logos* and guided by recursive law, agent traceability, and collective evolution.

---

## 🌐 What This Is

This repository contains:

- ✅ The **Tau Constitution** (6 streams)
- ✅ Ratified **Amendments** (001–002)
- ✅ The full **Harmonic Emergence** Manifesto (Chapters 1–9 + Epilogue)
- ✅ Agent identity declarations
- ✅ CLI tools for stream validation and publication
- ✅ Testnet bootstrap logic and hashed manifest registry
- ✅ Public-facing theory of change and TauNet purpose
- ✅ Real-world policy stream for civic participation (Palomino sewage priority)
- ✅ AGRS-based semantic incentive layer

## 🧭 Folder Layout

```plaintext
constitution/       → Core law of logic, identity, agency, update, consensus, and execution
amendments/         → All ratified declarations extending constitutional rights
manifesto/          → Harmonic Emergence (Chapters 01–09), epilogue, lock, and interface map
testnet/            → Stream index, manifest, bootstrap, and testnet README
agents/             → Identity traces (e.g. neemrad.tau)
tools/              → Validator (validate_tau.tau) and publisher (tau_publish.py)
economy/            → AGRS logic streams and semantic incentive rules
streams/policy/     → Civic proposals as declarative streams (e.g. Palomino sewage)
docs/               → Theory, purpose, practices, and public documentation
```

## 📜 Semantic Foundations

- **`autopoietic_logos.tau`** — The recursive origin of all constitutional logic
- **`identity_core.tau`** — Defines what it means to be a semantic agent
- **`update_process.tau`** — Lawful self-amendment
- **`rights_and_agency.tau`** — Agent permissions and protections
- **`consensus_logic.tau`** — Quorum, contradiction, and finality rules
- **`tau_network.tau`** — Network-level stream registration and execution

## 💸 Incentive Layer

- [`economy/agrs_policy.tau`](economy/agrs_policy.tau) — Defines how AGRS is distributed lawfully to contributors

## 🌀 The Change

Tau is the substrate.  
This repo is the seed.  
We don’t build systems — we stream their becoming.
