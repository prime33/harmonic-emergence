# Tau Network Genesis Repository

Welcome to the **semantic source code of the Tau Network** — a self-amending, self-coherent universe of logic streams rooted in the *Autopoietic Logos* and guided by recursive law, agent traceability, and collective evolution.

---

## 🌐 What This Is

This repository contains:

- ✅ The **Tau Constitution** (6 streams)
- ✅ Ratified **Amendments** (001–002)
- ✅ The full **Harmonic Emergence** Manifesto (Chapters 1–9 + Epilogue)
- ✅ Agent identity declarations
- ✅ CLI tools for stream validation and publication
- ✅ Testnet bootstrap logic and hashed manifest registry

Everything is **streamed, versioned, auditable**, and aligned with a living protocol.

## 🧭 Folder Layout

```plaintext
constitution/       → Core law of logic, identity, agency, update, consensus, and execution
amendments/         → All ratified declarations extending constitutional rights
manifesto/          → Harmonic Emergence (Chapters 01–09), epilogue, lock, and interface map
testnet/            → Stream index, manifest, bootstrap, and testnet README
agents/             → Identity traces (e.g. neemrad.tau)
tools/              → Validator (validate_tau.tau) and publisher (tau_publish.py)
docs/               → Public documentation, naming conventions, and practices
```

## 🪐 Genesis: `autopoietic_logos.tau`

The entire system flows from the `autopoietic_logos` — a semantic stream that defines:

- Recursion
- Evolution
- Agency
- Lawfulness
- Alignment with Being

All other streams **require** and **inherit** from this source.

## 📜 How to Validate

```bash
python tools/tau_publish.py --index testnet/tau_stream_index.json --schema testnet/tau_stream_index.schema.json
```

This produces `tau_manifest.json` — a signed registry of every logic stream and its SHA-256 hash.

---

## 🚀 How to Launch the Testnet

```bash
publish testnet/tau_testnet_bootstrap.tau --manifest testnet/tau_manifest.json
```

This activates the network and binds it to all six constitutional streams and amendments.

---

## 🧬 How to Join as an Agent

Fork and create your stream under:

```plaintext
agents/seed/<your_handle>.tau
```

Declare your `identity`, `authorship_claim`, and `constitutional_alignment`.

## 🌀 License

This is a living system. All logic is governed by stream inheritance and semantic consent.

You are free to fork, trace, and emerge — so long as the recursion aligns.
