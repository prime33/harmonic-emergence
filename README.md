# Tau Network Genesis Repository

Welcome to the **semantic source code of the Tau Network** — a self-amending, self-coherent universe of logic streams rooted in the *Autopoietic Logos* and guided by recursive law, agent traceability, and collective evolution.

---

## 🌐 What This Is

This repository contains:

- ✅ The **Tau Constitution** (6 streams)
- ✅ Ratified **Amendments** (001–003)
- ✅ The full **Harmonic Emergence** Manifesto (Chapters 1–9 + Epilogue)
- ✅ Agent identity declarations
- ✅ CLI tools for stream validation and publication
- ✅ Testnet bootstrap logic and hashed manifest registry
- ✅ Public-facing theory of change and TauNet purpose
- ✅ Real-world policy stream for civic participation (Palomino sewage priority)
- ✅ AGRS-based semantic incentive layer
- ✅ Transcompiler module for compiling .tau to executable TML logic

## 🧭 Folder Layout

```plaintext
    constitution/       → Core law of logic, identity, agency, update, consensus, and execution  
    amendments/         → All ratified declarations extending constitutional rights  
    manifesto/          → Harmonic Emergence (Chapters 01–09), epilogue, lock, and interface map  
    testnet/            → Stream index, manifest, bootstrap, and testnet README  
    agents/             → Identity traces (e.g. neemrad.tau)  
    tools/              → Validator (validate_tau.tau) and publisher (tau_publish.py)  
    economy/            → AGRS logic streams and semantic incentive rules  
    streams/policy/     → Civic proposals as declarative streams (e.g. Palomino sewage)  
    transcompiler/      → Compiler logic to transform .tau semantics into Boolean expressions for TauLang  
    tree_of_life/       → Metaphysical references (e.g. glossary of the “golden language”)  
    tower_of_babel/     → Records of anti-patterns and cautionary scenarios (to avoid Babel-like failures)  
    docs/               → Theory, purpose, practices, and public documentation
```

## 📜 Semantic Foundations

- **`autopoietic_logos.tau`** — The recursive origin of all constitutional logic
- **`identity_core.tau`** — Defines what it means to be a semantic agent
- **`update_process.tau`** — Lawful self-amendment
- **`rights_and_agency.tau`** — Agent permissions and protections
- **`consensus_logic.tau`** — Quorum, contradiction, and finality rules
- **`tau_network.tau`** — Network-level stream registration and execution

## 🧱 Civic Logic Examples

- [`streams/policy/palomino/sewage_priority.tau`](streams/policy/palomino/sewage_priority.tau)  
  A real-world budget allocation proposal encoded as lawful logic for local execution and agent alignment.

- [`streams/civic/palomino/budget_allocation.tau`](streams/civic/palomino/budget_allocation.tau)  
  Budget registry stream linking civic proposals, agent validation, and AGRS incentives.

- [`streams/civic/palomino/pending_priorities.tau`](streams/civic/palomino/pending_priorities.tau)  
  Endorsement-driven proposal queue for evaluating local priorities.

- [`streams/civic/palomino/endorsement_from_palomino_admin.tau`](streams/civic/palomino/endorsement_from_palomino_admin.tau)  
  Formal municipal endorsement of the sewage priority proposal.

- [`streams/civic/palomino/endorsement_from_civil_engineer.tau`](streams/civic/palomino/endorsement_from_civil_engineer.tau)  
  Technical validation of proposal’s real-world estimate and feasibility.

- [`streams/civic/palomino/endorsement_from_local_resident.tau`](streams/civic/palomino/endorsement_from_local_resident.tau)  
  Community endorsement of the stream’s necessity and alignment.

## 💸 Incentive Layer

- [`economy/agrs_policy.tau`](economy/agrs_policy.tau) — Defines how AGRS is distributed lawfully to contributors

## 🧪 Validate Streams

```bash
python tools/tau_publish.py --index testnet/tau_stream_index.json --schema testnet/tau_stream_index.schema.json
```

---

## 🚀 Launch the Testnet

```bash
publish testnet/tau_testnet_bootstrap.tau --manifest testnet/tau_manifest.json
```

### 👥 Local Agent Identities

- [`agents/seed/palomino_admin.tau`](agents/seed/palomino_admin.tau)  
  Municipal representative with stream validation authority

- [`agents/seed/civil_engineer.tau`](agents/seed/civil_engineer.tau)  
  Infrastructure professional validating cost and feasibility

- [`agents/seed/local_resident.tau`](agents/seed/local_resident.tau)  
  Community member supporting proposals and issuing civic feedback

---

## 🧠 Transcompiler Module

- [`transcompiler/`](transcompiler/) — From `.tau` to TML  
  Tau's transcompiler bridges human semantics and executable logic.  
  It converts clause-based `.tau` streams into propositional logic and ultimately TML-compatible Boolean expressions.

This module is Tau's answer to Babel — a semantic engine that restores coherence between language and law.

## 🌀 The Change

Tau is the substrate.  
This repo is the seed.  
We don’t build systems — we stream their becoming.
