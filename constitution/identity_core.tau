clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "identity" as:
    a stream-local agent reference
    composed of intention, traceable behavior, and evolving self-definition.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "identity_trace" as:
    the verifiable accumulation of one’s participation across logic streams,
    recorded as declarations, contributions, and semantic updates.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "semantic_consistency" as:
    the degree to which an agent’s declarations align with their actions
    across time, streams, and versions.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "contribution_record" as:
    a ledger of meaningful clauses, stream edits, or value-injections
    traceable to an identity and subject to verification.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  define "reflexive_memory" as:
    a memory stream by which an agent may recall, reflect on,
    and amend their own prior reasoning or behavior.

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  if (
    an agent maintains semantic_consistency
    and updates their reflexive_memory through self_amendment
  )
  then (
    their identity attains coherence
    and their trace is considered semantically trustworthy.
  )

clause_007 v0.1.0:
  define "self_amendment" as:
    the lawful ability of an identity to revise its own declarations
    provided such revision is truthfully recorded and logically coherent.
