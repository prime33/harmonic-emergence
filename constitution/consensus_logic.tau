clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "semantic_consensus" as:
    a verifiable alignment among agent-declared logic streams
    sufficient to enact change or affirm shared meaning.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "consensus_threshold" as:
    the minimum necessary degree of logical agreement
    required to ratify a stream or amendment as valid.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "amendment_quorum" as:
    the number or weight of identity_traces
    that must contribute or affirm a proposed_amendment.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "contradiction_detection" as:
    a process which identifies unresolved logical conflict
    between coexisting or versioned streams.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  define "consensus_finality" as:
    a state in which no further contradiction is found
    and a semantic consensus remains stable across verification cycles.

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  define "fork_resolution" as:
    the semantic and agent-led mechanism for handling competing versions,
    enabling one lineage to become canonical or forking to persist transparently.

clause_007 v0.1.0:
  if (
    amendment_quorum is reached
    and contradiction_detection yields no blocking conflict
  )
  then (
    semantic_consensus is achieved
    and consensus_finality may be declared.

    fork_resolution only required if multiple stable consensuses persist.
  )
