clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "network_genesis" as:
    the coordination point from which all Tau logic streams
    declare lineage, interface, and semantic commitment.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "stream_registry" as:
    a recorded map of logic streams,
    linking each stream to its provides, requires, version, and hash.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "agent_linkage" as:
    the mechanism by which identities bind themselves to stream participation,
    preserving trace, role, and reflexive memory across execution.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "constitutional_inheritance" as:
    the propagation of `autopoietic_logos`, `identity_core`, `rights_and_agency`,
    and `update_process` into all network-recognized semantic structures.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  define "trustless_coherence" as:
    a network condition where agents may compute alignment and stream integrity
    without privileged intermediaries or opaque computation.

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  define "stream_execution_scope" as:
    the declared domain within which a stream operates,
    including testnet, mainnet, local, forked, or sovereign zones.

clause_007 v0.1.0:
  if (
    a stream enters the tau_network registry
  )
  then (
    it inherits constitutional_inheritance
    and becomes executable under stream_execution_scope.
  )
