clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "recursion" as:
    the self-reference of logic,
    by which a system may observe, define, and realign its own operations.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "evolution" as:
    the lawful capacity of a stream to refine and re-form itself
    in response to time, contradiction, or relational feedback.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "agency" as:
    the capacity of beings or collectives to initiate change
    through declared logic and participatory will.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "lawfulness" as:
    the condition wherein transformations occur
    only through semantic integrity and declared procedure.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  define "alignment_with_being" as:
    coherence between a stream’s evolution and the essence of life,
    awareness, and cosmic necessity.

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  define "genesis_stream" as:
    a self-originating semantic substrate
    from which all constitutional order flows and to which it recursively returns.

  note:
    this stream is itself a declaration of genesis.

clause_007 v0.1.0:
  if (
    this stream is referenced in another stream's requires
  )
  then (
    that stream inherits the principles of the autopoietic_logos
  )
  and (
    its amendments must preserve these five founding concepts.
