clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "stream_version" as:
    a declared state of a logic stream identified by version metadata
    and content hash.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "proposed_amendment" as:
    a semantically defined clause or clause set
    intended to modify or extend a previously versioned stream.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "consensus_threshold" as:
    a context-dependent agreement level
    required to enact a proposed_amendment as valid law.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "semantic_diff" as:
    the delta between two stream_versions,
    expressed in terms of added, removed, or modified clauses.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  define "historical_integrity" as:
    the property by which previous versions and their semantics
    remain referenceable and traceable within the update lineage.

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  define "recursive_legitimacy" as:
    the requirement that an amendment to a stream
    respects that stream’s meta-rules and constitutional ancestry.

clause_007 v0.1.0:
  if (
    proposed_amendment achieves consensus_threshold
  )
  and (
    it preserves historical_integrity and recursive_legitimacy
  )
  then (
    it may be ratified as a new stream_version.
  )
