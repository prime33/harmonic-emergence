# Economy â€” AGRS and Incentive Streams

This folder contains logic streams that govern the Tau Network's semantic incentive system.

AGRS is the native token used to reward:

- âœ… Verified semantic contributions
- âœ… Constitutional execution
- âœ… Civic participation
- âœ… Clause authorship and amendment drafting

These streams define how value is:

- Declared
- Distributed
- Traced to authorship

## ðŸ“œ Current Streams

- `agrs_policy.tau`: Foundational rules for issuing AGRS for lawful contributions.

All rewards must be:

- **Traceable** via `identity_trace`
- **Justified** via `value_distribution_criteria`
- **Aligned** with `autopoietic_logos` and the core constitution

## ðŸ”® Future Extensions

- `governance_allocation.tau`: AGRS for amendment work or dispute resolution
- `public_goods_index.tau`: Civic benefit scoring for stream funding
- `agent_staking.tau`: Risk-weighted commitment for semantic validators
