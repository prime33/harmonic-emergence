clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "agrs" as:
    the native incentive token of the Tau Network,
    representing value alignment and semantic contribution.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "agrs_reward" as:
    a unit of value issued in recognition of stream creation,
    lawful amendment, verification, or proposal enactment.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "semantic_contribution" as:
    any clause, stream, or amendment that:
    (a) aligns with constitutional logic,
    (b) passes semantic validation, and
    (c) enters the network manifest.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "traceable_reward" as:
    an AGRS reward issued to a declared identity
    with proof of authorship and alignment.

clause_005 v0.1.0:

    the logic by which AGRS is proportionally allocated
    based on contribution type, trace weight, and network consensus.

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  if (
    a semantic_contribution is verified
    and it serves civic_participation or constitutional_execution
  )
  then (
    an agrs_reward may be issued
    and logged as a traceable_reward via identity_trace.
  )
