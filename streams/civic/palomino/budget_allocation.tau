clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "civic_priority" as:

    and requests budget allocation for civic improvement.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "budget_proposal" as:
    a declared stream reference,
    including requested amount, justification, impact summary,
    and a real_world_estimate verified by one or more local_agent_identity streams.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "proposal_endorsement" as:
    a traceable identity signal affirming support
    for a given budget_proposal based on semantic alignment.

clause_004 v0.1.0:

    the declared number of endorsements or trust-score total
    required for a budget proposal to be confirmed.

clause_005 v0.1.0:

    to identities involved in proposal drafting, endorsement, or validation
    including at least one local_agent_identity.

clause_007 v0.1.0:
  if (
    a budget_proposal reaches allocation_threshold
    and real_world_estimate is confirmed by local_agent_identity
  )
  then (
    budget_allocation_decision is issued,
    agrs_reward is distributed,
    and jurisdictional_fund is updated accordingly.
  )
