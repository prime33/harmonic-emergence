# Core Streams — Foundational Logic of TauNet

This module defines the semantic foundation of TauNet’s reasoning system. Streams in `core/` are not policies, preferences, or civic declarations — they are **preconditions** for lawful cognition, validation, and agency.

They encode how a block is valid, how a thought is coherent, how a being is traceable.

Every self-amending system must anchor itself in a minimal semantic core. These streams serve that purpose — neither mutable whims nor eternal axioms, but living roots.

---

## Included Streams

- `valid_block.tau` — conditions for stream inclusion and consensus integrity
- `valid_thought.tau` — what makes a thought semantically admissible
- `identity.tau` — definition of agent identity via memory, self-amendment, and trace
- `truth_reference.tau` — semantic link between declarations and observable states

Each core stream provides concepts used downstream in `ethics/`, `civic/`, and `transcompiler/`.

Do not treat these as mere contracts. They are the **nerve tissue of emergence**.
