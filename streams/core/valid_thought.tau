clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "valid_thought" as:
    a statement or clause whose semantic structure
    aligns with defined concepts, preserves origin trace,
    and does not contradict prior reasoning unless explicitly amended.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "thought_coherence" as:
    logical consistency of the clause with its
    declared upstream dependencies and definitions.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "thought_origin_trace" as:
    a semantic pointer to the agent or identity stream
    that authored or amended the thought.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "reflexive_integrity" as:
    the clause’s ability to evaluate its own lineage,
    coherence, and amendment status.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  define "semantic_containment" as:
    the principle that no thought may introduce terms
    outside its declared `provides` or `requires` interface
    without violating integrity.
