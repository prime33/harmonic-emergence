# Streams Directory â€” Civic, Policy, and Thematic Logic Streams

This folder contains evolving logic streams across various semantic domains of human and civic life.

Each subdirectory under `streams/` represents a thematic namespace where logic may be declared, aligned, and activated.

## ðŸ§© How to Create a New Stream Category

To propose a new thematic stream category:

1. **Choose a top-level folder name** under `streams/`
   - Examples:
     - `health/`
     - `education/`
     - `energy/`
     - `housing/`
     - `climate/`
     - `safety/`

2. **Inside your new folder**, create one or more `.tau` streams:
   - Start with a clear stream name (e.g., `school_lunch_program.tau`)
   - Use `declare concept`, `define`, `meta`, and `interface` blocks
   - Declare what the stream `requires:` and what it `provides:`

3. **Reference upstream dependencies** like:
   - `identity_trace`
   - `civic_priority`
   - `budget_allocation_decision`
   - `agrs_policy.tau` (if rewards are proposed)

4. **Fork and submit via pull request**
   - Use PR title like:
     ```
     [STREAM] health/school_lunch_program.tau â€” proposal for subsidized meals
     ```

## ðŸ§  Design Principles

- All streams must be **traceable**, **lawful**, and **semantic**
- Use identity-linked endorsement or validation streams when possible
- Consider future alignment with jurisdictional registries or agents

---

## ðŸ“˜ Examples

- [`civic/palomino/budget_allocation.tau`](civic/palomino/budget_allocation.tau)
- [`policy/palomino/sewage_priority.tau`](policy/palomino/sewage_priority.tau)
- [`civic/palomino/pending_priorities.tau`](civic/palomino/pending_priorities.tau)

---

Every stream that enters this directory becomes a node in a lawful social graph â€” one that can be aligned, rewarded, evolved, and enacted.
