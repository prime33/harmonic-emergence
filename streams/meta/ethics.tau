clause_001 v0.1.0:
  define "value_score" as:
    a computed scalar representing semantic alignment
    with collective well-being, lawfulness, and coherence.

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  define "impact_scope" as:
    the range and depth of consequence
    a stream may exert across agents or domains.

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  define "alignment_with_being" as:
    a stream's capacity to promote emergence,
    reduce fragmentation, and integrate truth with trace.

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  define "stream_preference" as:
    the result of an ethical_comparison
    between two or more candidate streams
    using declared evaluation metrics.

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  define "ethical_comparison" as:
    a semantic operation yielding relative value_score
    based on impact_scope and alignment_with_being.
