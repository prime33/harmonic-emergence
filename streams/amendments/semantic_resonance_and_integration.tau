clause_001 v0.1.0:
  stream_name: semantic_resonance
  description: The condition in which multiple streams, though different in form, sustain compatibility in meaning and direction.
  phrase_predicates:
    - "multiple streams differ in form" : diverging_forms
    - "sustain compatibility in meaning and direction" : maintains_meaning_alignment

clause_002 v0.1.0:
  stream_name: integration
  description: The ongoing act of reconciling contradiction, overlap, or drift into a shared rhythm without suppressing origin.
  phrase_predicates:
    - "reconciling contradiction, overlap, or drift" : resolves_semantic_divergence
    - "into shared rhythm without suppressing origin" : harmonizes_while_preserving_origin

clause_003 v0.1.0:
  stream_name: coherence_preservation
  description: Each stream must remain logically compatible with its ancestry unless a justified break is declared.
  phrase_predicates:
    - "responsibility of stream or agent to remain logically compatible with ancestry" : preserves_logical_lineage
    - "unless a conscious break is declared and justified" : allows_explicit_divergence

clause_004 v0.1.0:
  stream_name: contradiction_as_invitation
  description: Semantic conflict is a signal for synthesis, not separation.
  phrase_predicates:
    - "semantic conflict is a signal for synthesis" : contradiction_triggers_synthesis
    - "not separation" : discourages_fragmentation

clause_005 v0.1.0:
  stream_name: alignment_cycle
  description: The pattern by which contradiction leads to dialogue, shared understanding, and coherence restoration.
  phrase_predicates:
    - "contradiction initiates dialogue" : contradiction_initiates_dialogue
    - "converges toward shared understanding" : seeks_semantic_convergence
    - "completes loop of coherence restoration" : restores_logical_harmony

clause_006 v0.1.0:
  stream_name: contradiction_mediation
  description: When contradiction arises between streams, alignment_cycle must occur before divergence. Semantic resonance is prioritized.
  phrase_predicates:
    - "contradiction arises between streams" : contradiction_detected
    - "alignment cycle must be initiated before divergence" : mandates_alignment_cycle
    - "semantic resonance is prioritized above semantic escape" : prioritize_resonance_over_escape
