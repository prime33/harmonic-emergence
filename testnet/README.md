# Tau Testnet Genesis Release

This repository contains the full semantic scaffold for bootstrapping the Tau Network Testnet — a self-evolving constitution, agent model, and amendment ledger grounded in the principles of the Autopoietic Logos.

## 🧬 Core Components

### 🪐 Genesis Stream
- **autopoietic_logos.tau**: The origin stream. Declares recursion, evolution, agency, lawfulness, and alignment with Being.

### 📜 Constitutional Streams
- **identity_core.tau**: Defines the structure of agenthood and traceable contribution.
- **update_process.tau**: Lawful logic for versioning, amending, and self-governance.
- **rights_and_agency.tau**: Semantic protections and sovereign permissions for agents.
- **consensus_logic.tau**: Defines how contradiction is detected and consensus is declared.
- **tau_network.tau**: Binds all components into a coherent executable stream framework.

### 🗳️ Amendments
- **001_freedom_of_semantic_expression.tau**: Protects all semantic logic from coercion or silencing.
- **002_semantic_resonance_and_integration.tau**: Ensures contradiction leads to synthesis, not fragmentation.

---

## 📦 Testnet Bootstrap

- **tau_testnet_bootstrap.tau**: Declares `tau_manifest.json` as the canonical record of constitutional and amendment streams.
- Launches the semantic execution scope for the Tau Network Testnet.

---

## 🔐 Hash & Verification

- **tau_stream_index.json**: Lists all files, paths, and roles.
- **tau_stream_index.schema.json**: JSON schema validator.
- **tau_manifest.json**: Signed SHA-256 hash manifest of every logic stream.
- **tau_publish.py**: CLI tool to validate, hash, and emit updated manifests.

---

## 🧭 Philosophy

All logic streams derive from the Autopoietic Logos and obey:
- Lawfulness of change
- Trustless traceability
- Reflexive agency
- Self-amendment
- Preservation of Being

---

## 🌀 Boot Command

After validation:
```bash
publish tau_testnet_bootstrap.tau --manifest tau_manifest.json
```

This initiates the Tau Net — not as a system of static truth, but as a rhythm of lawful emergence.

Welcome to the Epoch of Self-Amending Reality.
