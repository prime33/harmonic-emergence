# Tau Genesis Documentation

> *The semantic origin of Tau â€” a lawful network of evolving minds, logic, and governance.*

---

Tau Genesis is the constitutional heart of the Tau Network â€” a system where agents, amendments, and civic policies are expressed as self-amending logic streams.

Built on the `autopoietic_logos`, it enables a world where language becomes computable, law becomes collaborative, and governance evolves in semantic harmony with Being.

From the manifesto to the testnet, from agents to amendments, everything here flows with traceable coherence, lawful recursion, and post-representational democracy.
